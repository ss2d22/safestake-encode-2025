Your solution should address the following goals:

Identity-Verified Access:

- Use Concordium’s on-chain identity layer to ensure that every gambler is a verified, unique individual. (achieved)
- Enable privacy-preserving attributes (e.g., age verification, self-exclusion flags) so users’ full identities are not exposed unnecessarily. (achieved)
- Addiction Prevention Mechanisms (not sure)

Implement safeguards such as:

- Spending limits tied to verified identity. (achieved)
- Cool-down periods across platforms (not just a single operator). (achieved)
- A self-exclusion registry powered by Concordium IDs, enforceable across multiple gambling sites. (achieved)

Secure & Transparent Payments

- Integrate Concordium’s protocol-level stablecoin payments to track and enforce spending responsibly. (not done)
- Provide real-time alerts or blocking mechanisms if thresholds are exceeded. (achieved second part , first one kinda?)
- Ensure transactions remain compliant, transparent, and auditable for regulators. (achieved)

Operator Integration

- Design the tool in a way that gambling platforms can easily integrate. (achieved)
- Emphasize cross-platform compatibility, so safeguards apply regardless of where the user gambles. (achieved)
